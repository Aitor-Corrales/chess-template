## Competition rules / Project requisites

- Create a web application to play chess with another player in real time ([chess rules in Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyes_del_ajedrez)).
- You must use Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView.
- There must be a graphical UI to perform chess movements.
- UI must be updated in real time.
- UI must display which player won the game, if any.
- Apart from the board, feel free to add user/game feedback and to decide how to display it.
- Any other enhancement will be taken into account for the final score.

### Scope

The idea is that two players should be able to play a single game. You can make reasonable simplifications, like:

- Create a game by accessing a random URL like `/game/:game_name`. Sharing that URL the other player would be able to join the game.
- The user that creates the game uses the white pieces.

### Chess Board

- There's a pre-defined chess board with styles you can use as a starting point. It looks like the one in the image below.
- Final HTML is provided, you are responsible of generating the HTML based on your project's data models.
